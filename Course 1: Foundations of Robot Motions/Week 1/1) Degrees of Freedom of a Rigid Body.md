1. Which of the following are possible elements of robots in this specialization? Select all that apply.
    - [x] Rigid Bodies
    - [ ] Soft, flexible bodies
    - [x] Joints


2. The number of degrees of freedom of a robot is (select all that apply):
    - [x] the dimension of its configuration space
    - [x] the number of real numbers needed to specify its configuration
    - [ ] the number of points on the robot
    - [ ] the number of joints of the robot
    - [ ] the number of bodies comprising the robot
    - [x] the number of freedoms of the bodies minus the number of independent constraints between the bodies

3. The number of degrees of freedom of a planar rigid body is\
    `3`

4. The number of degrees of freedom of a spatial rigid body is\
    `6`

5. A rigid body in `n`-dimensional space has `m` total degrees of freedom. How many of these `m` degrees of freedom are angular (not linear)?  Select all that apply.  **(This is consistently one of the most incorrectly answered questions in this course, so think about it carefully!)**
    - [x] m-n
    - [x] n(n-1)/2
    - [ ] Neither of the above
