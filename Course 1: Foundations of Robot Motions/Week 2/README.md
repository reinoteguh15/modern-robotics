# Week 2
## Topic : Configuration Space 

Learning Objectives:
- Distinguish between spaces of the same dimension but different global topology.
- Distinguish between properties inherent to a space (e.g., its dimension and topology) and issues that arise due to our particular representation of the space.
- Recognize the difference between an explicit parametrization of a space (using a minimum number of coordinates) and an implicit representation that uses more variables, subject to constraints.
- Give examples of pros and cons of explicit parametrizations and implicit representations of spaces.
- Understand and give examples of holonomic and nonholonomic constraints.
- Recognize the differences between configuration space, task space, and workspace.
