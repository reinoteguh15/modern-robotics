1. True or false? A nonholonomic constraint implies a configuration constraint.
    - [ ] True
    - [x] False

2. True or false?  A Pfaffian velocity constraint is necessarily nonholonomic.
    - [ ] True
    - [x] False

3. A wheel moving in free space has the six degrees of freedom of a rigid body. If we constrain it to be upright on a plane (no "leaning") and to roll without slipping, how many holonomic and nonholonomic constraints is the wheel subject to?
    - [x] Two holonomic constraints and two nonholonomic constraints.
    - [ ] Three holonomic constraints and zero nonholonomic constraints.
    - [ ] Zero holonomic constraints and three nonholonomic constraints.
    - [ ] One holonomic constraint and two nonholonomic constraints.

4. How many degrees of freedom does the upright wheel on the plane have? (What is the minimum number of coordinates needed to describe its configuration?)
