# Week 3

## Topic: Rigid Body Motions

Learning Objectives:
- Use rotation matrices to represent the orientation of a frame, to change the reference frame in which a vector or a frame is represented, or to rotate a vector or frame.
- Represent the angular velocity of a frame as a 3-vector in the space or body frame, or as a $3 × 3$ skew-symmetric matrix in $so(3)$.
- Use the matrix exponential to calculate the new orientation of a frame if it rotates with a fixed angular velocity for a given time.
- Represent the orientation of frame 2 relative to frame 1 as a 3-vector of exponential coordinates representing an angular velocity (in frame 1 coordinates) multiplied by a time that takes frame 1 to frame 2.
- Calculate the matrix log of a rotation matrix, which returns the $3 × 3$ $so(3)$ matrix representation of an angular velocity which rotates the identity matrix to the given rotation matrix in unit time.
